# Typescript Introduction

## What does Typescript do?
- Typescript transpiles into JS so advanced features not available to all web browsers can be used by providing a polyfill.
- Enforces static typing to catch potential issues.

# Why use typescript?
- fast transpilation
- converts code to ECMAScript ("code once, works everywhere" analogy)
- works with various libraries, frameworks and package management tools
- Static typing, which makes it easier for code refactoring
- Easy to maintain
- Good support for intellisense
